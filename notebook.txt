Experiments:

We run the following 5 experiments on this three-machine model, with 5 runs each:

# Experiment 0: Run with default settings
# Experiment 1: All clock rates are exactly the same
# Experiment 2: 0, 1 are slow clock rate, 2 is very very fast
# Experiment 3: 0 is slow, 1 and 2 are fast
# Experiment 4: Default clock rates, but super likely to send messages (act_range down to 4)

These experiments cover a wide range of cases where the machines run at different rates and also
are more or less likely to send messages to each other.

Execute the experiments using 
$ ./experiments.sh
